## Instructions 

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Set up and activate a `virtualenv`. 
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.text` 
4. Run `./main`
5. For best results, please do not resize the terminal window

## Rules 
The objective is to identify a set of three cards.
Each card has four features: shape, color, number, and shading which each can vary in 3 ways. For each one of the 4 features, 3 cards (a set) must display that feature as either all the same, or all different. If two cards are the same and 1 card is different in any feature, then it is not a set. Please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set) for more detailed instructions.
